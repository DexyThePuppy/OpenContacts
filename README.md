# Contacts++

Messenger App for Neos VR contacts.

[Get it here](https://github.com/Nutcake/contacts-plus-plus/releases/latest)

## Building

This is a standard Flutter application, refer to the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on how to build it.

Currently only Android is supported.

In theory this app should also build fine for desktop, though not every feature will be functional. 
For example, voice-messages and notifications are currently not supported on desktop builds.
